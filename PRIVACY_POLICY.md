Welcome to  Hotels near me app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Francisco Miranda.

All data created is used by the app only. The app does not store any data. When the app is off the data is lost. 
The user can make phone calls but user data is not transmitted off device in the call.
The application also takes the location of the user, then access Geocoder y sends the location
to obtain the state and zipcode the user is in. Data is transmitted  to Geocoder web side but the app does 
not send any user's data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding 
how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will fix it.

Yours sincerely,

Francisco Miranda
