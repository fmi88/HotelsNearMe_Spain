This is an open source Android app developed by Francisco Miranda.
All data created is used by the app only. The app does not store any data. When the app is off the data is lost. 

The application takes the location of the user, then access Geocoder and sends the location to obtain the provincia the user is in. 
Location is transmitted to Geocoder  but the app does not send any user's data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have 
any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will fix it.
Yours sincerely,
Francisco Miranda
